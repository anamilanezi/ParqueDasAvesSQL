-- 1. The table us_counties_2010 contains 3,143 rows, and us_counties_2000 has
-- 3,141. That reflects the ongoing adjustments to county-level geographies that
-- typically result from government decision making. Using appropriate joins and
-- the NULL value, identify which counties don't exist in both tables. For fun,
-- search online to  nd out why theyâ€™re missing

-- Condados que existiam em 2000 deixaram de existir em 2010
